<div class="intro-box">
I lead an interdisciplinary research group that reimagines and recombines the fundamental building blocks of practical chemistry — reagents, media, and energy — to create new paradigms for chemical synthesis and discovery. Using a broad toolbox of ideas and techniques spanning synthetic chemistry, computer science and programming languages, signal processing and statistics, and aerosol science. Pioneered the first programmable aerosol reactor.

## Employment

<div class="position">
<span class="position-title">Leverhulme Early Career Fellow</span>
<span class="institution-date">University of Glasgow, UK | 2022–2025</span>
</div>

In my fellowship I have created a modular, digitally controlled aerosol reactor and championed its adoption as a mainstream medium for chemical synthesis and discovery. Applications ranging from materials chemistry to antimicrobial discovery are being pursued within my group and via collaborators.

<div class="position">
<span class="position-title">Post-doctoral Researcher</span>
<span class="institution-date">Cronin Group, University of Glasgow, UK | 2018–2022</span>
</div>

Focal points include (i) the digitisation of synthetic chemistry, leading to [two](#chempu){.link-publication} [Science papers](#xdl){.link-publication} and commercialisation via a patent that now underpins [a £40M spin-out company, Chemify Ltd]{.link-commercial}; (ii) introducing Bayesian probability as a tool to automate the interpretation of chemistry experiments leading to.

<div class="position">
<span class="position-title">Specialist</span>
<span class="institution-date">Health Canada, Canada | 2017–2018</span>
</div>

I devised a system combining signal processing algorithms with probability theory to automate the quantitative analysis of complex forensic drug samples. Alongside continued development at Health Canada and nationwide deployment, the underlying technical innovations were [published](#nmr){.link-publication} in a special issue of *Mag. Reson. Chem.*

## Education

<div class="position">
<span class="position-title">PhD – Chemistry</span>
<span class="institution-date">University of British Columbia, Canada | 2012–2017</span>
</div>

From doped silicon to superconductors, control of electronic structure has transformed the landscape of possible material properties. Translating this idea to the field of organic chemistry, I demonstrated how the interplay of molecular shape and electron delocalisation can modulate and even defy properties like aromaticity and bond lability.

<div class="paper-highlight">
**Hydrogel microdroplets as next-generation reactors:** Chemical synthesis in microdroplets can accelerate reactions and enable unique reaction pathways, but existing methods provide limited control over droplet composition and environmental conditions. Using programmable aerosol chemistry, we developed a platform for creating chemically distinct microdroplet populations and demonstrated its utility through the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks.

<div class="paper-highlight">
Tandem mass spectrometry is a formidable tool for analysing complex mixtures of unknown compounds, e.g. exoplanet samples, but pinpointing compounds of interest without extrapolating from currently known species remains a challenge. My contribution to this paper, the *recursive molecular assembly* (RecursiveMA) algorithm, searches tandem MS dataset for evidence of shared molecular building blocks to differentiate complex molecules from those that are simply large.

<div class="paper-highlight">
**A fresh take on AI in chemistry:** The applications of AI in chemistry are proliferating, yet instead of empowering expert chemists to undertake larger-scale experiments, most efforts supplant the chemist with data-hungry and opaque models. Bridging Bayesian probability and chemistry, we built a system that encodes and formalises chemists' intuition into a probabilistic model working in tandem with a robotic chemistry platform to explore large experimental spaces and plan

<div class="paper-highlight">
**On-demand digital synthesis:** Just as the digitisation of music led to on-demand streaming services, we demonstrate how digitization of the chemical literature enables an automated synthesis platform to directly execute published procedures without human intervention. The work highlights the power of abstract chemical description languages in separating procedure specification from hardware-specific implementation details.

**Hardware-independent synthesis automation:** Digitising synthesis requires in-depth knowledge of vendor specific programming interfaces and lengthy development to adapt literature protocols to robotic execution. Our high-level hardware-independent chemical programming language XDL formalises the chemical literature's universal method for describing synthesis procedures in prose and translates these descriptions to robot-ready instructions.

<div class="paper-highlight">
**Aromaticity challenged:** Electronic structure effects in organic chemistry are traditionally understood as limited to immediately adjacent atoms or through-bond conjugation. Here we show that multi-centre electron delocalisation over a molecular framework can override such local effects, opening doors to molecules with unusual bonding and electronic properties.
