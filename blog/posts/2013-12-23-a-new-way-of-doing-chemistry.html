<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about a new way of doing chemistry. Take for
example the case of growing crystals. In the more difficult cases, this
involves trial and error using a number of educated guesses about the
solvents and conditions. What if we had an algorithm that would decide
the best procedure based on a database of molecular metrics, e.g.,
dipole moment, molecular weight, melting point, decomposition
temperature, functional groups, hydrogen bonding, etc. for solutes as
well as solvents, trained on a series of successful/unsuccessful
combinations, e.g., naphthalene from hot ethanol, macrocycle x from DMSO
+ ether by diffusion at room temperature, compound y from slow
evaporation of hexanes solution?</p>
<p>This of course can be generalized to any chemical transformation.
Publicly available databases like Org. Syn. can be mined for information
that no one chemist can hope to memorize, significantly reducing the
amount of trial and error in day-to-day chemistry.</p></div>
