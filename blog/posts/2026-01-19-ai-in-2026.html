<p>Living through the first couple of weeks of 2026 it is clear, whether
I like it or not, that it will be yet another year dominated by AI. I
have to be honest, looking back, this growing presence is something I’ve
had mixed feelings about, having gone through the usual cycles of
excitement, epiphany, frustration and despair that countless of us seem
to have experienced. It’s been a technical and emotional rollercoaster
like discovering, falling in love with, then good old times</p>
<p><strong>Up #1:</strong> Before GitHub Copilot, there was GitHub
Codex, the predictive autocomplete for VS Code. This was great for those
obscure pandas incantations that never seemed to make it into muscle
memory. A function signature, maybe a comment or the beginning of the
line <code>combined_df =</code> and more likely than not the right
completion would show up as ghost text.</p>
<p><strong>Down #1:</strong> Over the Christmas break of 2023, I set
myself two challenges: use SQL to reason about molecular assembly; and
write a Raspberry Pi camera image acquisition GUI to make life easier
for my students who had to use the command line to capture images and a
text file for documents. With the camera challenge specially Codex
seemed completely clueless. This was around the <code>raspicam</code> to
<code>libcamera</code> transition and there just didn’t seem to be a way
to prompt it to use the more modern stack (in fairness to Codex, there
was probably next to nothing in its training data about this).</p>
<p><strong>Up #2:</strong> In 2024, when GitHub Copilot’s <em>Edit</em>
mode popped up in my editor one day, there was a feeling of immense
power as I prompted Claude Sonnet 3.5 to create <a
href="https://github.com/MehrResearch/microbit_sensornet">interactive
web UIs</a> that I could never dream of having the time to learn coding
on my own. I even prototyped an <a
href="https://github.com/MehrResearch/Delphi2">IDE for probabilistic
modelling</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Down #2:</strong> Then the code (and dead code) started to
grow, I lost track of how and where things were implemented, what was
still in use vs left over from the last prompt. You had to be sure that
the right source files were added to context or the model would
ignore/reimplement existing functionality, blissfully unaware that it’s
right there.</p></div>
