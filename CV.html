<p><strong>Chemistry–Information–Discovery:</strong> I lead an interdisciplinary research group re-visiting the fundamental building blocks of practical chemistry — reagents, reaction media, and energy — in the context of pervasive automation, bespoke experimental hardware and analytics, and massive expansion in computational power, with the aim of devising new paradigms for chemical synthesis and discovery.</p>

<h3>Leverhulme Early Career Fellow <span> University of Glasgow, UK | 2022–2025 </span></h3>
<p>My fellowship aims to leverage automation and computational modelling to radically expand the gamut of interpretable experimental regimes in chemistry, with chemistry in aerosols as a first paradigm. I have created a modular, digitally controlled aerosol reactor — the first of its kind — and championed its adoption as a medium for chemical synthesis and discovery. Applications ranging from materials chemistry to antimicrobial discovery are being pursued within my group and via collaborations.</p>

<h3>PhD – Chemistry <span> University of British Columbia, Canada | 2012–2017 </span></h3>
<p>From doped silicon to superconductors, the ability to fine-tune materials’ electronic structure has transformed the landscape of possible material properties. Translating this idea to the field of organic chemistry, I demonstrated how the interplay of molecular shape and electron delocalisation can modulate and even defy properties like aromaticity.</p>

<em>Digital Discovery</em>, <strong>2024</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00139G">10.1039/D4DD00139G</a>) Selected for display on front cover of December 2024 issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aerosol-generated hydrogel microdroplets as miniature self-assembled reactors:</strong> Hydrogel matrices hold promise as a locus for inhomogeneous chemistry, especially in the micron range, where reactants and products can be transported via diffusion. In this work, we generated reactive microdroplets of sodium alginate which, upon contact with and cross-linking with a reagent-loaded solution of calcium ions, acted as hydrogel containers for subsequent <em>in situ</em> reactivity within them.</p>

<h3>Reaction blueprints and logical control flow for parallelized chiral synthesis in the Chemputer</h3>
<p>Šiaučiulis, M.; Knittl-Frank, C.; <span class="underline">Mehr, S. H. M</span>; Clarke, E.; Cronin, L. <em>Nat. Chem.</em>, <strong>2024</strong>, <em>in press</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Evolving a chemical programming language:</strong> Early means of programming robotic modules for chemical synthesis show immense promise for deployment in research and industrial labs, but lack the fundamental constructs — re-usable reactions, parallel synthesis, and a higher-level representation of reagents and hardware — needed to tackle more ambitious synthetic challenges. This paper demonstrates first-class implementation of these constructs in the χDL 2.0 language whilst maintaining compatibility with the existing repertoire of procedures digitised via χDL 1.0.</p>

<p>Tandem mass spectrometry is a formidable tool for analysing complex mixtures of unknown compounds, e.g. exoplanet samples, but pinpointing compounds of interest without extrapolating from currently known species remains a challenge. My contribution to this paper, the <em>recursive molecular assembly</em> (<a href="https://github.com/hessammehr/recursiveMA">RecursiveMA</a>) algorithm, searches tandem MS dataset for evidence of shared molecular building blocks to differentiate complex molecules from those that are simply large.</p>

<p><strong>Digital signal processing and statistics to counter drug epidemics:</strong> Developing bespoke analytical protocols for drug detection is resource intensive and time consuming, incompatible with the challenge of tackling rapidly emerging drug epidemics, such as the fentanyl crisis.

<p><strong>Aromaticity challenged:</strong> Electronic structure effects in organic chemistry are traditionally understood as limited to immediately adjacent atoms or through-bond conjugation.
